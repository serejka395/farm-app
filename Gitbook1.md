# 🚜 Farm2Earn: Whitepaper & Game Manual

> **Status:** LIVE (Alpha)  
> **Blockchain:** Solana  
> **Token:** $F2E (TGE Pending)  
> **Version:** 0.8.2 (Winter Protocol)

---

# 1. Introduction

## The Vision
**Farm2Earn** is not just a game; it is a **gamified DeFi protocol** built on the Solana blockchain. We bridge the gap between casual idle gaming and high-yield decentralized finance. 

In a world of complex DeFi dashboards, we offer a simple proposition: **Plant seeds, grow assets, harvest value.**

Our mission is to create a sustainable, player-owned economy where time and strategy translate directly into ownership. By leveraging Solana's lightning-fast speeds and negligible fees, we enable micro-transactions that make every action—planting, watering, harvesting—feel tangible and rewarding.

## Why Solana?
- **Speed**: Instant confirmations for harvesting and planting.
- **Cost**: Transactions cost fractions of a cent, allowing for high-frequency gameplay without gas anxiety.
- **Ecosystem**: Direct integration with Phantom, Backpack, and Solflare wallets.

# 2. Economy: The Zenomics

Farm2Earn operates on a **Tri-Token Model** designed to balance inflation, encourage reinvestment, and reward long-term holders.

## 🪙 1. ZEN (Soft Currency)
*The Fuel of the Farm.*
- **Utility**: Buying seeds, basic plot maintenance.
- **Source**: Selling crops, Daily Quests.
- **Burn Mechanics**: Buying seeds, expanding early plots.

## 🟡 2. GOLD (Premium Currency)
*The Wealth Standard.*
- **Utility**: Purchasing high-value animals, buying special upgrades, unlocking premium buildings.
- **Source**: Rare animal drops, Achievements, converting SOL (indirectly via shop upgrades).
- **Burn Mechanics**: High-tier upgrades, Winter Lodge purchase.

## ⚡ 3. $F2E (Governance Token)
*The Ownership Layer (Phase 3 TGE).*
- **Total Supply**: 1,000,000,000
- **Utility**: Staking, Governance votes, Marketplace currency.
- **Distribution**:
    - **40% Community (P2E Rewards)**
    - 20% Liquidity
    - 20% Team (Vested)
    - 10% Early Adopters (Airdrop)
    - 10% Staking

> **🛡️ Innovation: The "XP is Equity" Model**
> During Alpha, players earn **XP**. This XP is not just a level counter; it is your **Airdrop Weight**. The more you play and progress now, the larger your allocation of $F2E at the Token Generation Event (TGE).

# 3. Gameplay Mechanics

## 🌾 Farming Loop
The core of the game is managing your **18 Plots** of land.
1.  **Unlock**: Plots must be purchased. The first 6 are free. The last plot costs **5 Billion ZEN** or requires Level 100.
2.  **Plant**: Choose from **25+ Crops** across 6 Rarity Tiers.
    -   *Strategy*: Plant **Wheat** (10s) for active play or **Void Pumpkin** (48h) for passive yield.
3.  **Water**: Water boosts growth speed by **1.6x**. Water charges are a limited resource, creating a sink for ZEN/SOL.
4.  **Harvest**: Collect crops to gain **XP** and **Inventory**.

### Crop Tiers

| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Common** | Wheat, Garlic, Carrot | Low Margin / High Speed | Active Clickers |
